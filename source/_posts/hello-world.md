## Dear visitor
Welcome to my own personal blog! This is my literal "Hello World". I've never really felt the need to have a blog up until recently. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of writing essays. These days I feel that my brain's memory capacity is reaching its limit. I believe that the human brain also have a limit just like computer hard drives :). So I will treat this blog as a memoir for me to remind my future self what an adventure it was. Warning: this blog may contain substantial grammatical errors from this point on...
